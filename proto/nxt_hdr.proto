// source, dest, sport, dport, proto: standard five tuple associated with any
// flow. destSvc is the service name - like dest can be google IP say 1.1.1.1
// and destSvc can be "google.com"
//
// sourceAgent: the service name of the source agent/connector that can be used
// in the return direction to get back to the same agent/connector
//
// destAgent: the service name of the dest agent/connector. This field may (or
// may not) be the same as the "destSvc" field. For example if the destSvc field
// is a private service like kismis.org, the destAgent will be the same as
// kismis.org. But if the destSvc field is say google.com, then the destAgent
// can be set to say default-internet. In other words, destAgent gives the
// sender (agent/connector) flexibility to either say "route to whoever provides
// flow.dest" by setting flow.destAgent same as flow.dest OR to say "route
// exactly to this particular service" by setting a specific value for
// flow.destAgent different from flow.dest. The cluster always routes based on
// flow.destAgent field
//
// agentUuid: The unique id of the agent originating the flow. This is used only
// in clusters and connectors, agents and connectors dont fill it or use it
//
// type: two types of nextensio flows - raw l3 packets, tcp/udp terminated l4
//
// usrattr: set of extra attributes for the flow - typically filled in the
// cluster after OPA lookup This is used only in clusters. Agents and connector
// dont fill it or use it
//
// responseData: This indicates the direction of the data. The first data that
// creates the flow is considered the request and the opposite direction is
// considered response. Agents dont fill this, connectors do fill this depending
// on whether the flow is originated from the connector or originated via
// gateway
//
// userCluster and userPod: This is also filled up only by clusters, agents and
// connectors dont have to fill this in. This identifies the "source" cluster
// and pod for the flow, to aid the return path in getting back to the source
//
// userid is same as onboard.userid to propagate the userid along the flow
//
// traceCtx is the Jaeger traceid (context) from the Uber-Trace-Id HTTP header.
// traceRequestId is the user's trace request for executing the trace policy.
// It is used to relate the trace spans to the user's trace request
//
// connectorPod is used to tell the Connector which cluster and cpod it is
// connected to. The cpod will be a replica and is not the same as the pod id 
// in connectID.
// We can remove this if the cpod can pass this info to the Connector during
// onboarding.
